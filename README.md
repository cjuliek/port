User Stories!

As a junior software engineer, I want users to be drawn into my portfolio so that they want to reach out to me as a prospective employee. As a prospective employee, I want users to take note of my background in leadership positions as a collaborator, who works alongside their team so that every member learns and develops together.

MVP Goals
-multiple sections that connect with a link
-various sets of image carousels
-multiple pages that connect

Stretch Goals
-Create an alternate welcome page where user selects to see everything in a 'day' or 'night' mode
-usable 'contact' function

Unsolved Problems
Did not get to stretch goal of a 'day' / 'night' mode for page. 
Instead of creating a separate page as a method of contact, I was able to enable direct email contact through clicking on 'email' under 'Contact' on my index page. When clicking it, the user will be prompted to email through user's OS automatic setting.
