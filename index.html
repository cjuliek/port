            <p> I am a software engineer with a background in mentorship. I found my passion in the development of my cohort as I collaborate and learn alongside them myself. Through aligning my personal values with professional ethics, I have found that it is vital to be mindful of individual development with the end goal in mind. It acts as a guidance and becomes an overall enriching experience while completing projects.</p>
